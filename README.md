# Rosetta Stone

This project is intended to be a programming **Rosetta Stone**. Here you'll find algorithms in various coding languages.

This project is born with the idea that the best way to learn how to code is coding itself. Yes, **coding is a learning by doing task**.

## Organization

Algorithms will be organized in folders. Each folder will contain a **readme.md** explaining the problem and the algorithm implementations in various languages.

## Languages

The first version will include the following languages:
* Python
* JavaScript
* Go

More languages will be continously added with Pull Requests. Feel free to fork and add another language!

## Contribute

You're strongly encouraged to contribute and add your own language! Open/close issues, fork the repo and make a Pull request! All ideas are welcome.
